			text: 'With no boilerplate code and little Svelte-specific syntax, Svelte feels just like vanilla JavaScript, making it a great framework for beginners to easily pick up. While it is beginner friendly, it does not sacrifice any best practices or features. In fact, Svelte can do everything other popular frameworks can do and more. Because of this, it is more than just a good starting point for beginners.'

Its syntax was simple and its mental model intuitive. </p><p>Though there is much gnashing of teeth over web development neophytes skipping the fundamentals and going straight to frameworks, I will make the case for why starting Svelte helped changed the arc of my career.</p>'

			title: 'Svelte Transitions and Accessibility',
			text: "<p>Svelte includes built-in animations that makes it easy to slide, scale, and fly elements in and out of the DOM. However, you need to be careful to not trigger motion sickness in your users. I will go over which Svelte transitions could cause accessibility issues and how to respect user motion preferences when using them.</p><p>We'll iteratively build a solution to change which transition we use when the user requests reduced motion -- first only using CSS, then detecting the user's motion preference in a Svelte component, to finally encapsulating the logic in a reusable Svelte store.</p>"

			text: "<p>I'll be honest here. Svelte didn't capture my attention for its slick templating language, its state management, or really its DX in general. No, I fell in love since the Svelte 2 days because of one dream: finding a runtime-less *disappearing* framework.</p><p>This new trend towards 'partially' hydrating pages with little nuggets, or islands, of interactivity (see Astro) is *built* for such a JS-light approach. So let's discuss why Svelte is my framework of choice for islands architecture, and how 11ty + Slinkity can bring these islands to any HTML template.</p>"

It uses their declarative structure and makes it easy to write complex form validations that are also easy to read and maintain.</p>'
