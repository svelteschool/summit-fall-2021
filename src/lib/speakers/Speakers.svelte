			text: "With no boilerplate code and little Svelte-specific syntax, Svelte feels just like vanilla JavaScript, making it a great framework for beginners to easily pick up. While it is beginner friendly, it does not sacrifice any best practices or features. In fact, Svelte can do everything other popular frameworks can do and more. Because of this, it is more than just a good starting point for beginners."

In the process I'll demonstrate how Svelte's powerful features enable both Primo's component-driven development & lean, accessible, fast-loading static sites."

			text: "<p>After failing to learn React, Svelte swooped in to rescue my frontend learning journey by allowing me to build things fast. Its syntax was simple and its mental model intuitive. </p><p>Though there is much gnashing of teeth over web development neophytes skipping the fundamentals and going straight to frameworks, I will make the case for why starting Svelte helped changed the arc of my career.</p>"

			title: "Svelte Transitions and Accessibility",
			text: "<p>Svelte includes built-in animations that makes it easy to slide, scale, and fly elements in and out of the DOM. However, you need to be careful to not trigger motion sickness in your users. I will go over which Svelte transitions could cause accessibility issues and how to respect user motion preferences when using them.</p><p>We'll iteratively build a solution to change which transition we use when the user requests reduced motion -- first only using CSS, then detecting the user's motion preference in a Svelte component, to finally encapsulating the logic in a reusable Svelte store.</p>"

			title: "The 'how' and 'why' of islands architecture with Svelte + Slinkity",
			text: "<p>I'll be honest here. Svelte didn't capture my attention for its slick templating language, its state management, or really its DX in general. No, I fell in love since the Svelte 2 days because of one dream: finding a runtime-less *disappearing* framework.</p><p>This new trend towards 'partially' hydrating pages with little nuggets, or islands, of interactivity (see Astro) is *built* for such a JS-light approach. So let's discuss why Svelte is my framework of choice for islands architecture, and how 11ty + Slinkity can bring these islands to any HTML template.</p>"

			text: "<p>Forms were not always a part of the web, in fact, they were only added in HTML2, and even to this day writing them feels like they are an afterthought.</p> <p>Vest is a powerful form validations framework inspired by the syntax and style of unit testing libraries like Mocha or Jest. It uses their declarative structure and makes it easy to write complex form validations that are also easy to read and maintain.</p>"

In this session you'll learn some techniques for adding Svelte to any web project. You'll also see how to reuse your existing JavaScript widgets inside your Svelte components, whether they are React components, or even ancient jQuery plugins!"

			text: "Finite state machines provide an elegant, powerful approach for modeling complex behavior, and are ideally suited to many UI components. Alas, existing JavaScript FSM implementations feel verbose and bloated alongside Svelte's elegant, minimalist syntax. No more! svelte-fsm is the Svelte-esque FSM library. Discover the joy and benefits of using svelte-fsm to manage your components' state."

Its simple design makes it great for beginners who are trying to break into tech, but it's also powerful and extremely fast for devs who need to be hyper-focused on being productive. Plenti takes care of common things you need for building websites, including connecting your Svelte components to a data source, client routing, hydrating to a single page app (SPA), and creating HTML fallbacks for each page to improve performance and SEO."
